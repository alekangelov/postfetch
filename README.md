# preFetch
## a microlibrary for fetching stuff

Will explain more later. Maybe.

preFetch.getData("url goes here", [{key/value pairs of parameters of get request}]);
preFetch.postData("url goes here", {object you want to pass through});
preFetch.putData("url goes here", {object you want to pass through});
preFetch.deleteData("url goes here", {object you want to pass through});
